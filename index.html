                           <p style =" color: #e64b77;">The semester abroad program(SAP) offered by BITS Pilani is aimed at providing students the right international exposure to ensure wholistic education in every sense of the term. The program allows students to spend a semester in a foreign university having an MoU with BITS or any other university ranked within top 400 universities by the QS or THE ranking systems. 
To apply for SAP, a student must have completed all CDCs of his/her respective branch before the semester they wish to spend in a foreign university.  <br></p>
<p style ="color: #21759b;">The SAP application in the foreign university of choice is the responsibility of the interested student. BITS allows the semester abroad program subject to a student’s acceptance in the respective University’s program.
To apply for the program, the student will have to fill and submit the application form for SAP available on the IPCD website. The form requires the students to fill the details of the university they wish to spend their semester at, the courses they are going to take up in the university and the corresponding equivalent courses offered at BITS.<br></p>
<p style ="color: #3BDF92;">To confirm the equivalent courses offered at BITS, a prescribed form can be filled and submitted to HODs who will approve the equivalence of the courses.
The filled application form will then be sent to AUGSD (first degree) or AGSRD (higher degree) for approval. After approval, information is sent to the partner university. On completion of the semester abroad, the credits of the courses completed will be transferred from the partner university to BITS and added to the student’s academic record.<br></p>
<p style =" color: #e64b77;">The application form has to be submitted to IPCD Office (Room No.C-228) on or before the last day of classwork of the semester, before SAP semester (usually 30th Nov and 30th Apr). As many as 56 students took an off-campus thesis and completed their thesis work from some of the best universities like NUS Singapore, Max Plank Institute Germany and IISC Bangalore in the second semester of the academic year of 2019-20.</p>
